- Hackathon Project that allows users to access certain applications even without wifi or cellular data. 
- The idea behind this android applications was users don't always have access to the internet but still need to access essential data
- This app uses Twillo APIs and Google APIs on the backend and a nice android interface to allow users to request data through text message
- For example, if a user needs directions to and from a place, he/she can simply imput a start and end location in our app and we will return the step by step directions without ever needing wifi/cellular data
- Other features of our app include wiki pages of things a user requests and translations of phrases
- All data is transmitted using text messages and then rendered on our front end Android application
